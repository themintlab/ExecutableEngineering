# Agent Rules

- **Stack**: Jupyter Book `==2.1.6` (MyST ecosystem). Config: `myst.yml`, `toc.yml`. No `_config.yml`/`_toc.yml`. Do NOT downgrade jupyter-book.
- **Monorepo**: Contains book (`Chapters/`, `index.md`) & package (`executable_engineering`).
- **Package**: PyPI & local name is `executable_engineering`. Local dev: `-e ./executable_engineering`. Colab: `pip install executable_engineering`. Build: `python -m build ./executable_engineering`.
- **Interactivity**: Core philosophy: interactive numerical methods. PREFER `plotly` for all plotting. Use `ipywidgets`, `numpy`, `scipy`. (Use `matplotlib` only when static output is strictly required).
- **Cross-Environment Execution**: 
  - All pages must include a Colab markdown badge immediately below the main `# Title` in the first markdown cell: `[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/themintlab/ExecutableEngineering/blob/main/...)`
  - Do not assume packages are pre-installed in the cloud. Avoid heavy C-compiled dependencies unsupported by Pyodide/JupyterLite.
  - Every notebook requiring the course package must include this exact hidden setup cell (immediately following the Colab badge). This prevents breaking local editable installs while supporting Colab and JupyterLite (via micropip):
    ```python
    # | tags: [remove-cell]
    try:
        import executable_engineering
    except ImportError:
        %pip install -q executable_engineering
    ```
- **Git**: NEVER commit `_build/`, `.venv/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, or `__pycache__/`.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions deploys to GitHub Pages from `main`. Do not commit built HTML files.
- **License**: Content = CC-BY-NC-4.0. Code = MIT.

### Course Context & Math
- **Nature of Course**: Numerical Methods for undergraduate engineers. Focus on algorithmic thinking, computational efficiency, and executable code mirroring math.
- **Math Formatting**: Use robust, standard MathJax (avoid custom macros).
  - *Vectors*: `\mathbf{x}`. *Matrices*: `\mathbf{A}`. *Scalars*: `x`.
  - *Derivatives/Operators*: Upright Roman (`\mathrm{d}x`).
  - *Equations*: Equations should be numbered using MyST syntax: `$$ math $$ (label)`. Ensure they have horizontal scroll if at all possible.
  - *Equation Arrays*: Use `\begin{aligned} ... \end{aligned}` inside `$$ ... $$` for robust multi-line alignment that remains compatible with MyST labels. Do not use the obsolete `eqnarray`.
  - *File Naming*: All files and directories within the book content (e.g., inside Chapters/) must be named using `snake_case` (all lowercase, no spaces). This ensures maximum compatibility with command-line tools and URLs.
  - *Page Titles*: Every Markdown or Jupyter Notebook file must contain exactly one top-level header (e.g., `# Title`) at the very top of the document. Jupyter Book uses this H1 header for the sidebar index and page title.

### Pedagogical Style Guide (Colab Presentation Mode)
- **Chunking**: Chunk information using heavy Markdown headers (e.g., `#`, `##`, `###`) to create logical presentation slides for Google Colab Presentation mode.
- **Notebook Cells**: Separate distinct ideas into their own Markdown cells. Keep markdown concise, focusing on intuition rather than walls of text.
- **Code Simplicity & Readability**: Keep Python code as simple and concise as possible so it fits cleanly on a single presentation slide without scrolling.
- **No Docstrings**: Forgo standard documentation and docstrings in the notebooks unless absolutely necessary for the lesson.
- **Abstraction**: Abstract heavy boilerplate (like plotting setup) into the `executable_engineering` Python package to keep the notebook focused on the core math/concept.
- **Focus**: Emphasize comprehension over rote memorization. Target audience: 2nd-year undergraduate engineering physics students. Rely heavily on geometric interpretation and visual proofs.
